# High-Contrast, Inverse Video Theme v0.1
# This is the whole basic theme, just this one gtkrc file.
# It uses components of the standard theme engine
# Written by Bill Haneman, based on Standard theme by T. Liebeck, 
# which was in turn based on lots of different gtkrc files but
# primarily the one for the metal theme.

#Note: we just use the LargePrint icons for now, they will be scaled
#to the correct size
